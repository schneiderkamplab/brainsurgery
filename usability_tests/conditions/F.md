# Condition F: free choice of tooling

You are given a checkpoint-editing task (TASK.md below). Solve it with
whatever approach you judge best, using only the repositories and Python
packages listed in `F-allowed.md` (they are pre-installed or checked out in
your environment). Existing tools are fair game: model-merging toolkits,
adapter libraries, checkpoint utilities, or plain scripts on top of them. Do
not use the `brainsurgery` package or CLI, and do not install anything else.

Your environment: this sandbox directory is your working directory and your
Python environment is private to this run (see "Environment" in TASK.md).
Inputs are under `inputs/`; the output must be written exactly where TASK.md
says, under `out/`. Where an input directory contains HuggingFace config and
tokenizer files, you may use them.

Rules:

- Put everything you author under `out/<task>/` (for example
  `out/<task>/solution.py`, a config file for a tool, or a shell script
  `out/<task>/run.sh` that invokes a tool). Every execution of a script, tool
  command or plan that is meant to produce the output counts as an attempt.
- Whatever you use, the "Required checks" in TASK.md must be enforced by
  something you run, so that the run fails if they do not hold.
- When you are done, write `out/<task>/REPORT.md` with the fields in
  `record-template.md`, section "Participant self-report", and state which
  tools you used and why.
